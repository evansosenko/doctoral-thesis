  Two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides entwine
  interaction, spin-orbit coupling, and topology.
  Hole-doped systems lack spin degeneracy:
  states are indexed with spin and valley specificity.
  This unique structure offers new possibilities
  for correlated phases and phenomena.
  We realize an unconventional superconducting pairing phase
  which is an equal mixture of a spin singlet and the $m = 0$ spin triplet.
  It is stable against large in-plane magnetic fields,
  and its topology allows quasiparticle excitations
  of net nonzero Berry curvature via pair-breaking circularly polarized light.
