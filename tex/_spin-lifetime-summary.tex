\section{Summary}
\label{s:summary}

In this chapter we have analyzed the effect of contact resistance
on spin lifetimes determined via the Hanle spin prescession technique
in nonlocal spin valves.
The general expression for the precession curves given
in \cref{eq:f} is the main new result.
While aspects of the discussed phenomena have been addressed numerically before,
an analytic solution is obtained here
which allows for detailed characterization of the device.
In particular, general features of scaling
as well as various limits and regimes can be analyzed.
In addition, the solution allows for fitting data
using standard curve fitting algorithms.
