\section{Conclusions}

In this letter, we report on the nature of the superconducting state
of hole-doped TMDs.
Remarkably, the correlated state inherits
the valley contrasting phenomena of the non-interacting state.
While the magnitude is smaller, pair-breaking produces quasiparticles
that have the same Berry curvature, and hence the same anomalous velocity.
Thus one predicts an anomalous Hall response unlike the valley Hall response
observed in \ce{MoSe2}.

Spin-valley locking leads to large critical magnetic fields.
A similar phenomena was recently reported in heavily hole-doped
(beyond the spin-split gap) \ce{NbSe2}
\cite{Xi2016}.
In the new regime, where only one band per valley intersects
the chemical potential, no pair-breaking occurs
for in-plane fields unless disorder is present.

While systematic synthesis and characterization of hole-doped systems
is still in its early stages, the fact that other two-dimensional compounds
and their bulk counterparts are known to be superconducting
\cite{%
  PhysRevB.88.054515%
}
provides impetus to explore this novel phenomena.
