    The geometry of the nonlocal spin valve analyzed in this chapter is shown.
    There are two ferromagnetic electrodes placed on a conducting channel.
    Current $I$ flows into the left electrode,
    while the potential $V$ is measured at the right electrode.
    The nonlocal resistance is defined as the ratio $V / I$.
    For spin dependent phenomena, the relevant quantity of interest
    is the difference between the nonlocal resistance for the parallel
    and antiparallel orientations of magnetization of the two electrodes.

The assumed device geometry is shown in \cref{fig:nonlocal_spin_valve}.
Two ferromagnetic contacts ($F$) are deposited
on the normal semiconductor ($N$).
A spin-polarized current $I$ is injected through the contact at $x = 0$
and flows in the $x ≤ 0$ region of the semiconductor.
The voltage difference $V$ is measured at
$x = L$ between the contact and the semiconductor.
The nonlocal resistance is $\rNL = V / I$
\cite{PhysRevB.67.052409}.

Spin transport is modeled by identifying two spin channels
and their associated three-component spin electrochemical potentials $μ_{↑↓}$.
The majority channel is labeled as up,
while the minority channel is labeled as down.
The voltage difference is proportional to the spin accumulation
$μ_s = \left( μ_↑ - μ_↓ \right) / 2$ at $x = L$.
The spin accumulation in the semiconductor
is assumed to satisfy the steady-state Bloch diffusion equation
\begin{equation}
  D ∇^2 μ_s^N - \frac{μ_s^N}{τ} + ω × μ_s^N = 0 .
\end{equation}
The key parameters are
the contact spacing $L$,
the diffusion constant $D$,
the spin lifetime $τ$,
the spin diffusion length $λ = \sqrt{D τ}$,
and $ω = \left( g μ_B / ℏ \right) B$ which is proportional to
the applied magnetic field $B$ and the gyromagnetic ratio $g = 2$.

For contacts which cover the width of the channel,
the transport is uniform along $y$.
Since the channel is two-dimensional, $μ_s^N$ will only vary along $x$.
We enforce the boundary condition $μ_s^N → 0$ at $x → ± ∞$
and the continuity of the current and spin current.
A detailed derivation is given in \cref{s:appendix} and reveals
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance}
  \rNL^± = ± p_1 p_2 R_N f .
\end{equation}
The overall sign corresponds to
parallel and antiparallel ferromagnetic alignments.
Specifically, we find a resistance scale
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W L} \frac{1}{σ^N} ,
\end{equation}
and the function
\begin{multline}
  \label{eq:f}
  f = \re \left( \left\{
        \vphantom{
          \frac{
            \sinh{ \left[ \left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} \right] }
          }{\sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
        }
        2 \left[ \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} + \frac{λ}{2} \left( \frac{1}{r_0} + \frac{1}{r_L} \right) \right]
        e^{\left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
        \right. \right. \\ \left. \left.
        + \frac{λ^2}{r_0 r_L} \frac{
            \sinh{ \left[ \left( L / λ \right) \sqrt{1 + i ω τ} \right] }
          }{\sqrt{1 + i ω τ}}
      \right\}^{-1} \right) .
\end{multline}

Note that $f$ is unitless and depends only on the scales
$L / λ$, $ω τ$, and $λ / r_i$.
The parameters $r_i$ with $i$ either $0$ for
the left contact or $L$ for the right are
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r-parameter}
  r_i = \frac{R_F + R_C^i}{\rSQ} W ,
\end{equation}
where $R_F$ is the resistance of the ferromagnet
and $R_C^i$ are the individual contact resistances,
$W$ is the graphene flake width, and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:square_resistance}
  \rSQ = W / σ^N ,
\end{equation}
is the graphene square (sheet) resistance
given in terms of the semiconductor conductivity $σ^N$.
The resistances $R_F$ and $R_C^i$ are the effective resistances
of a unit cross sectional area.
They are defined in \cref{eq:contact.resistance,eq:ferromagnet.resistance}.
To obtain an expression in terms of the ohmic resistances,
one must make the substitutions
$R_F → W_F W R_F$ and $R_C^i → W_F W R_C^i$,
where $W_F$ is the contact width, i.e., $W_F W$ is the contact area.
We will use the same symbols for either resistance type
when the meaning is clear.
The polarizations $p_1$ and $p_2$, defined in \cref{eq:polarizations},
model the effective current injection.
They depend on the resistances and the spin polarizations
of the semiconductor and the individual contacts.

The expression $Δ \rNL = \abs{\rNL^+ - \rNL^-}$
measures the difference in signal between
parallel and antiparallel field alignments.
We combine $P^2 = \abs{p_1 p_2}$
\footnote{
  Assuming the polarizations $P_σ^F$ and $P_Σ^L$
  have the same sign bounds $P ≤ 1$.
},
and write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nonlocal_resistance.difference}
  Δ \rNL = 2 P^2 R_N \abs{f} ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  R_N = \frac{λ}{W} \frac{1}{σ_G} ,
\end{equation}
where $σ_G = σ^N L$ is the graphene conductance normally given in units of
$\si{\milli\siemens} = \left( \si{\milli\ohm} \right)^{-1}$.
